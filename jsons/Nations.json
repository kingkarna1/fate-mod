		"startIntroPart1": "The Demon Hunter Organization (退魔組織, Taima Soshiki?) is an important element of the Nasuverse within the stories of Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, and Kagetsu Tohya. Though it is not often referred to directly, it is related to many of the core characters of those stories. The Organization is made up of four families, all of whom have a psychic ability. The Organization's main opponent are the Mixed-Blood descendants from the Oni Kind, which partially included the Tohno Family. However, even some members of the Organization are known to have inhuman blood coursing through their veins.",
		"startIntroPart2": "The main purpose of the organization is simple: destroy demons or Mixed-Bloods that have thick demon blood, as they see them as an abnormality that must be corrected. A Demon is a disruption and Demon Hunters are a gathering of those who fix the disruption within nature but they can't fix the disruption within humans. Because the Demon Hunters are an organization in the lawful spell branch, created by humans to protect the human society, as such, they are not supposed to hurt humans. For that reason, they will have a difficult time against a Mixed-Blood, as they are not a disruption. In order for a hybrid to be considered a disruption, the demon blood needs to become thicker than the human blood. These demon hybrids who can't maintain the human side anymore are seen as being out of alignment, and the Demon Hunters finally see them as their target. However, when the hybrids go out of alignment, they become the worst enemy for the Demon Hunters. Because they have a human side, binding spells won't work on them and because they have the alien power of the demons, it's impossible to stand up against them with the body of a human. In the past when weapons were undeveloped, killing them meant many casualties. However the Nanaya family apparently did have some sort of understanding with the Tohno family, as evidenced by their reaction during the Tohno family's attack",
